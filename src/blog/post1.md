Her essence bleeds with her need for passion. The fire in her soul igniting with every heartbeat and exhaled out, a puff of smoke with each frustrated sigh.

She’s been locked behind walls stacked brick after brick. Always moving from house to house, year after year but never a home. She surrendered to the prison of matrimonial military, loneliness.  A cage disguised as safety but built by and always for another. Her soul yearning to break out, to break free.

Her spirit needing a chance to reclaim dreams from a past life. To instead be captured within the warmth of hug and the coziness of a family, to feel the slight burn in the belly that only comes from a night full of belly laughs with childhood girlfriends.  Lastly, to feel the longing and desire of a man who will appreciate all of her and the sacrifices she willingly makes for love.  A man who will treasure her beauty and a man who has it in him to match her fire and scorch her body with his own desire.

A tiny red ember just waiting to spark her back to life, to be stoked into a full-on blaze, so that she can burn her way to freedom and to feel the heat of true happiness.

So, she fights...  for herself, knowing that soon she will rise again, with flames behind her, all around her, and for the fire just waiting within her.  She will born again from the ashes.  She will not submit to “Defeat, Divorce, or to Despair.   She will burn like she was always meant to.  

She is a phoenix. 

She is Fire.

She is Woman.

She is Red.
